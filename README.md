# San Marino Towers Challenge

Built for [Jet Lag: The Game](https://www.youtube.com/@JetLagTheGame)

## Overview

A companion app for the San Marino episode that brings the famous Monty Hall probability problem to life using the three historic towers. Players must physically climb the towers of San Marino (Guaita, Cesta, and Montale) while making strategic decisions based on the Monty Hall problem.

The challenge works as follows:

1. Choose one of the three towers to climb first
2. After climbing, you'll learn which of the other two towers is incorrect
3. Make your final choice: stick with your original tower or switch to the remaining one
